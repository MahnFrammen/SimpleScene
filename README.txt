My entry for CST-310 Project 8 - Simple Demo Scene.

To run the programs:

Download the project files from the GitHub repository 
Save them to the same directory and open that directory in the Ubuntu terminal 
Use the following commands to run the program and display the Demo scene: 'g++ Project8.cpp -o Project8 -lglut -lGL -lGLU' './Project8'. 


Packages lGL, lGLU and lglut are used to run this program, which can be obtained by using command 'sudo apt-get install libGL-dev'
